This repository will contain the necessary files to build a webpage describing the history and culture of the Yamabushi people (literal translation: "One who lies down on the mountain" -- google translate) in the country Yama Juunin ("Mountain Residents" -- google translate) for an Open Legends campaign.

The following include the pages and the content to be on each page, They will be re-ordered after I finish adding in the content. 

## History of Yama Juunin: 
Yama Juunin has had a very tubulent history, the mountains have had many civil wars and bloody conflicts. Most of these conflicts were power grabs from different clans that either ended in usurping the previous reign, splitting the region into two government powers, or greusome death for the rebels.

- if Ben has no preference, I may do a simple 'three fold path'

## Government & Politics
Ultimately, this is a feudal society. There are defined class systems, roles, and expectations with them. i.e. in britain, a lord of a manor was expected to provide protection to the free tennants and villanes that were under him, he was also expected to play the roll of judge in local disputes. The tennants are expected to work some of the Lords land in return.

- the cliche is that dwarves always are chief exporters of rare earth minerals, I'm debating reversing that, have them export stone and ingredients to make things like concrete, non-neutonian liquids, petrolium gell, and while this isn't an export yet they have most recently developed black powder. using it to make the first cannon in the world. (it's still pretty rudimentary and inacurate over more than 50 meters)
