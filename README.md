# Yama-Juunin
This repository will contain the necessary files to build a webpage describing the history and culture of the Yamabushi people (literal translation: "One who lies down on the mountain" -- google translate) in the country Yama Juunin ("Mountain Residents" -- google translate) for an Open Legends campaign.

---

The following include the pages and the content to be on each page, They will be re-ordered after I finish adding in the content. 

## History of Yama Juunin: 
Yama Juunin has had a very tubulent history, the mountains have had many civil wars and bloody conflicts. Most of these conflicts were power grabs from different clans that either ended in usurping the previous reign, splitting the region into two government powers, or greusome death for the rebels. 

## Culture:
> A cutlure is defined by the customs, arts, social institutions, and achievements of a particular nation, people, or other social group. 

Using that definition I will break this into groups. 

### Customs

### Arts

### Social Institutions

## People:

## Divinities:
Rather than a pantheon of gods, the Yammabushi have been battered and bloodstained by centuries of conflict and war. Once the old empire took control, the dwarves were directed into *The Three Paths*. These paths are not just a frivolus religion that some dwarves follow and others don't. It's their way of life, these philosophies are worth dying for in their eyes and many do. Magistrates swear to serve a lord by publicly swearing to follow one of the paths. If they break the path they are killed, outcast, imprissoned, or ostricized from a community.
- **The Three Paths**
  - Path of Honor
  - Path of Efficiency
  - Path of Peace
Each of the three paths has several sub paths that define and make up the parent path. These sub paths are not written or defined by the Yammabushi, but rather the natural channels and interpretations of what the philosophy is.
Through these paths the social order is built and maintained. 

---

### Path of Honor:
- **Ideal:** Honor above all else
- **Typical Social Roles:** Warriors, Judges, Magistrates 
- **Cultural Flavor:** Oaths are forged into weapons, armor, or are engraved in a small stone tablet that the bearer takes with them everywhere. 
**Interpretations:** *[ ^= Most common interpretation]*

| Interpretation      | Role / Occupation                | Core Philosophy | Cultural / Psychological notes. |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Path of Ilumination | Vassals, Oathkeepers, Magistrates| Truth is absolute; deception and concealment are anathema | Believes any lie or hiddn action is dishonorable. Some duel over the most minor offenses. Wear bright armor, and engage in highly ritualized conduct. |
| Path of Oathbound^  | Vassals, Warriors | Honor is in keeping promises above all else. | Even mercy or practicality cannot justify breaking an oath. Creates rigid moral absolutists. |
| Path of Service^    | Retainers, Low Nobles, servants | Self-sacrifice is an ultimate honor. | Loyalty to others is paramount. Produces disciplined, loyal followers who may suppress personal desires. |
| Path of Pure Blood  | Aristocrats / elite warriors | Honor is a hereditary virtue | Can foster classism or eugenics. Strong emphasis on lineag and inherited nobility. |

### Path of Efficiency
- **Ideal:** Refinement is the ultimate manifestation of divinity
- **Social Roll:** Engineers, bureaucrats, alchemists, tacticians.
- **Cultural Flavor:** See invvention not as creation, but as refinement of what already exists. An inventor doesn't make, they perfects. 
- **Architecture and Tools:** Wcwet city and machine is built with modular precision, meant to be repaired, never replaced. Efficiency is not speed, it's eternal functionality. 
**Interpretations:** *[ ^= Most common interpretation]*

| Interpretation      | Role / Occupation                | Core Philosophy | Cultural / Psychological notes. |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Silent Forge^       | Artisans, Engineers, Alchemists  | Creation is sacred; work in silence | Often vow silence during work. Focused, methodical, emotionally restrained. |
| Golden Scale^       | Merchants, Traders, Bureaucrats  | Wealth and productivity are measures of moral worth. | Equates economic success with virtue. Can foster ruthless competition. |
| Calculated Mercy    | Scholars, Strategists, Advisors  | Decisions are based on outcomes rather than emotion. Can rationalize harsh, choices. | 

### Path of Peace:
- **Ideal:** Peace is the truest form of mastery.
- **Social Roll:** Monks, philosophers, healers, elemental magicians. 
- **Cultural Flavor:** Their meditation halls are built inside dormant volcanoes and deep caverns, places of immense pressure and silence. Peace is not the absence of tension, but mastery over it. 
**Interpretations:** *[ ^= Most common interpretation]*

| Interpretation        | Role / Occupation                 | Core Philosophy | Cultural / Psychological notes. |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Peace Through War^    | Warrior-monks, Elite Peacekeepers | Strength and readiness maintain serenity | Trains to fight only to prevent greater bloodshed. Weapons are symbols: sheathed, but always within reach. |  
| Compassionate Chains^ | Philosopher-lords, Enforcers, Vassals | Control as mercy; order prevents suffering | Kaigen's preferred ideology. Subjugation seen as kindness. Can justify authoritarian rule. |
| Last Breath           | Monks, Healers, Pacifists         | Absolute nonviolence; self-sacrifice | Believes in allowing oneself to be harmed rather than harming others. often seen as saints or fools. |

### Unspoken
This is a new path that is emerging in the unseen corners of Yamma Juunin. It's philosophy not fully defined, yet the current regime is aware of it, and the threat it may pose. They activly hunt those who practice it, accusing them of crimes, and subsequently execute them. 

| Path     | Role /Occupation                     | Core Philosophy  | Cultural / Psychological notes |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Unspoken | Ronin, Wanderers, Heretics, peasants | Reject all paths | Considered dangerous by orthodox society. Philosophical rebels. Can spark rebellion in those who subscribe to its practice |

## Government & Politics
Ultimately, this is a feudal society. There are defined class systems, roles, and expectations with them. i.e. in britain, a lord of a manor was expected to provide protection to the free tennants and villanes that were under him, he was also expected to play the roll of judge in local disputes. The tennants are expected to work some of the Lords land in return. 

## Economy & Trade
- Resources
- markets
- trade routes
- currency.

- the cliche is that dwarves always are chief exporters of rare earth minerals, I'm debating reversing that, have them export stone and ingredients to make things like concrete, non-neutonian liquids, petrolium gell, and while this isn't an export yet they have most recently developed black powder. using it to make the first cannon in the world. (it's still pretty rudimentary and inacurate over more than 50 meters)
